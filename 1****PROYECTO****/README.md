## Project summary:

This project is a system of a restaurant, where you can buy what is on the menu and then generate a ticket, you will choose if you want to eat on the restaurant or pick house delivery and then the program will help the employee to process the payment.

------------
## Structure:
The program will start showing two options:
- customer order.
- employee options.


------------



### Cusotmer order: 
This option will start with a menu where you can choose which operation you would like to do:
- breakfast menu.
- lunch menu.
- dinner menu.
- drinks menu.
- home delivery.
- generate ticket.
- give your opinion about the restaurant.




*1. The food menus:* 
 The **food menus** will have all the dishes available to choose from, the client can add as many as he or she wants to their ticket.

*2. The drinks:*
 The **drinks menu** will have all the different options the customers will have to drink, such as water, juices, milkshakes, etc. and  you can add  whichever they want to their ticket. 
 
 *3. Home delivery:*
 In this part of the program the client is going to choose if they want to eat in the restaurant or they want **home delivery**, if they choose the second option the program will ask for their address and contact information. 

*4. Generate ticket:*
 In this section you can **generate the ticket** for everything that the customers are going to buy.

*5. Give your oinion about the restaurant:*
The customer will write a review about the restaurant completely anonymous to help improve the service, a .txt file will be generated with the opinion given above.




------------
### Employee options:
This second part will be simpler than the previous one, in this section the employee will have this options:
- check my salary.
- review employee discounts.

*1. Check my salary:*
 The employee can check their week **salary**, the program will ask them how many hours they work per week, then the program will calculate the salary depending on which area they are working in the restaurant.

*2. Review employee discounts:*
 They will obtain different **descounts** depending on how much time they have been working in the restaurant.
