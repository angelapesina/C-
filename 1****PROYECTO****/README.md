## Project summary:

This project is a system of a restaurant, where you can buy what is on the menu and then generate a ticket, you will choose if you want to eat on the restaurant or pick house delivery and then the program will help the employee to process the payment.

## Structure:
The program will start showing two options:
- customer order.
- employee options.

### Cusotmer order: 
This option will start with a menu where you can choose which operation you would like to do:

- give your opinion about the restaurant.




*1. The food menus:*
