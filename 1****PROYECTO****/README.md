# PIA: Restaurant 

## Project summary:

This project is a system of a restaurant, where you can buy what is on the menu and then generate a ticket, you will choose if you want to eat on the restaurant or pick delivery and then the program will help the employee to process the payment.

------------
## Structure:
The program will start showing two options:
- customer order.
- employee options.


------------



### Cusotmer order: 
This option will start with a menu where you can choose which operation you would like to do:
- breakfast menu.
- lunch menu.
- dinner menu.
- drinks menu.
- generate ticket.
- home delivery.
- payment.


*1. The food menus:* 
 The **food menus** will have all the dishes available to choose from, the client can add as many as he or she wants to their ticket.

*2. The drinks:*
 The **drinks menu** will have all the different options the customers will have to drink, such as water, juices, milkshakes, etc. and  you can add  whichever they want to their ticket. 


*3. Generate ticket:*
 In this section you can **generate the ticket** for everything that the customers are going to buy.


*4. Home delivery:*
 In this part of the program the client is going to choose if they want to eat in the restaurant or they want **home delivery**, if they choose the second option the program will ask for their address and contact information.  


*5.Payment:*
 Finally, in this part the program will help the employee to calculate the final payment and how much mony is going to return to the customer. 

------------
### Employee options:
This second part will be simpler than the previous one, in this section the employee will have this options:
- check my salary.
- review employee discounts.

*1. Check my salary:*
 The employee can check their month **salary**, the program will ask them how many days they work per week and how many hours, then the program will calculate the slaary depending on which area they are working in the restaurant.

*2. Review employee discounts:*
 They will obtain different **descounts** depending on how much time they have been working in the restaurant. 

------------
> *I may add more things while I'm doing the code but this is the base of my program.*

------------



### +Ideas 
Some other ideas that I have but I am not pretty sure if I am going to implement in my project:
- make a .txt file for purchase reports
- make a .txt file for employees
- make a .txt file for clients (with their personal information)
